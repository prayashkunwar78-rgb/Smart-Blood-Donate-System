# Smart Blood Donation System - Nepal
The Smart Blood Donation System is a modern, interactive web application designed to connect blood donors across all 77 districts of Nepal.
The main purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use platform where users can register themselves as blood donors, search for donors by blood group
or district, and update or remove their information when necessary. The user interface (index.html) has been built using Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive,
mobile-friendly, and visually appealing layout. The donor registration form allows users to enter their name, select their blood group, and 
choose their district from a dynamically populated list of all 77 districts of Nepal. The interface also includes a search section, which enables users 
to filter donors based on blood group and district, with interactive results displayed in a card-based layout.

All the functionality of the system is handled in app.js, which contains modular JavaScript code to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
on donor data. Donor records are stored in the browser’s localStorage, providing persistent data that remains available even after refreshing the page. 
Users can edit existing donor information, delete entries, and instantly see the updates reflected in the donor list.
The search functionality dynamically filters donors in real-time based on the user’s selection, making the system efficient and user-friendly. 
All form inputs are validated to ensure data integrity before saving or updating records.

This project leverages modern web technologies including HTML5 for structured layout, CSS3 and Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-first styling, and 
JavaScript ES6+ for DOM manipulation, form handling, and localStorage management. The design incorporates hover effects, animations, and a grid-based card
layout to improve user experience and maintain a professional look.

The Smart Blood Donation System is ideal for anyone who wants to contribute to social causes by becoming a registered donor, as well as for people who need
to quickly find donors in emergencies. The project is fully responsive, works on both desktop and mobile devices, and demonstrates best practices in UI/UX
design, modular JavaScript development, and client-side data persistence. This repository can also serve as a portfolio-level project for demonstrating your
web development skills, including front-end design, interactivity, and application logic.

Developed by Prayash Kunwar, this project provides a practical and scalable solution for blood donation management in Nepal, showcasing a combination of 
technical skills and social impact.
